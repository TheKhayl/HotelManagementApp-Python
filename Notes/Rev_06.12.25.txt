Rev's Note:

1. Added the Initial Database as of now June 12, 2025.

2. Added the Notes folder for any notes by the developers if they want to drop in some reminders.

3. Added a Connection for the Database in the main.py file and organized it for future use.

4. Added a class folder under main folder to practice Object Oriented Programming, 
	because some parts of the program are worth separating from the main file for maintainability and readability.
